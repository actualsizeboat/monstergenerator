# Info

This tool is intended for advanced game masters - it might throw some wacky or unbalanced stuff at you. Don't entirely trust my challenge rating estimates. This software is provided without warranty. I am not responsible for any dismemberment, failed death saving throws, or total party kills that may arise from using this software.

By comparing various values (HP, armor class, damage per round, number of traits, number of actions, etc.) of SRD monsters at different challenge ratings, a new monster can be procedurally created. In this readme, I will provide a brief overview of the generation process.
